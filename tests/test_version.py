"""The root VERSION file and its exposure through /health.

VERSION is the single source of truth for the release machinery:
`.github/workflows/release.yml` tags when it changes, and `speed.yml`
benchmarks HEAD against the release it names. Both read the file with
`cat`, so its shape matters as much as its content — a stray second line
or a `v` prefix would produce a malformed tag.
